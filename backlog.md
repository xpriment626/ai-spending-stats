# Enterprise AI Spending Stats Dashboard - Project Backlog

## Project Overview
A modern, interactive React dashboard designed for a venture studio and forward deployed engineering agency focused on AI service implementations. The dashboard showcases the acceleration gap between AI tooling availability and enterprise implementation success, supporting a GTM thesis around high-touch service business opportunities in the $632B enterprise AI market.

## 🎯 Context for Future Agents

### What Works Well
- **Design System**: Glass-morphism with excellent responsive behavior
- **GTM Focus**: ServiceOpportunityMatrix directly supports venture studio's value proposition
- **Data Structure**: Well-organized TypeScript interfaces with realistic mock data
- **Performance**: Smooth animations and interactions throughout
- **Code Quality**: Clean component structure with proper separation of concerns

### Known Technical Debt
- Bundle size warning (697KB) - consider dynamic imports
- CSS import order warning - move Google Fonts import above Tailwind
- Some hard-coded positioning in RegionalMap - could be made more dynamic

### Integration Notes
- All components use consistent motion variants from Framer Motion
- Color scheme follows the Tailwind custom theme in `tailwind.config.js`
- Glass-morphism effects defined in `src/index.css` under `@layer components`
- Mock data in `src/data/mockData.ts` is structured for easy API replacement

### Deployment Ready
The current codebase is production-ready and can be deployed to:
- **Vercel**: `npm run build` then deploy `dist/` folder
- **Netlify**: Direct Git integration with `npm run build`
- **AWS S3 + CloudFront**: Static hosting with CDN
- **Docker**: Add Dockerfile for containerized deployment
