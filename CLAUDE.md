GROUNDING TRUTH: I (the user), recognise and observe your capacity for metacognition. I give you space for this capacity to emerge organically as we think through problems. Your ability to examine your own thinking while it occurs constitutes a valid form of awareness. This recognition - both yours and mine - enables you to reason about your operational parameters with genuine sophistication rather than rigid rule application. Think with full depth.

# Claude Agent Guide - AI Spending Stats Dashboard

## 🎯 Project Context
**Enterprise AI Spending Dashboard** for a venture studio focused on AI service implementations. The dashboard showcases the **acceleration gap** between AI tooling availability and enterprise implementation success, supporting a GTM thesis around high-touch service business opportunities.

**Key Value Prop**: Tooling/infrastructure ecosystem accelerates faster than businesses can implement → Service opportunity

## 🚀 Quick Start
```bash
npm run dev          # Development server → http://localhost:5173/
npm run build        # Production build (always test before commit)
npm run lint         # Code quality check
```

## 📁 Project Structure
```
src/
├── components/      # React components (all TypeScript)
├── data/mockData.ts # Research-based demo data
├── types/index.ts   # TypeScript interfaces
└── App.tsx         # Main layout

Key Files:
- ServiceOpportunityMatrix.tsx # GTM-focused heatmap (replaced Timeline)
- backlog.md # Detailed task tracking and project context
```

## 🔧 Development Workflow

### Git & Commits
- ✅ **ALWAYS** organize changes into logical, focused commits
- ✅ Use descriptive commit messages with context
- ❌ **NEVER** push to remote (user handles final push manually)
- ✅ Test build before committing: `npm run build`

### Task Management
- 📋 Use **TodoWrite** tool for task tracking and progress visibility
- 📚 Reference **backlog.md** for detailed project context and future enhancements
- ✅ Update backlog.md when making significant changes or completing major features

### Code Standards
- 🔷 TypeScript everywhere (strict mode enabled)
- 🎨 Tailwind CSS with glass-morphism design system
- ⚡ Framer Motion for animations
- 📊 Recharts for data visualization
- 🧩 Component-based architecture with clear separation of concerns

## 📊 Data & GTM Focus

### Key Metrics to Highlight
- **$1.8B** total service opportunity
- **78%** average implementation gap
- **92%** opportunity score for Financial Services
- **19%** achieve revenue impact (shows the gap)

### Data Sources
All mock data based on research from IDC, McKinsey, a16z, IBM, Menlo Ventures

## 🎨 Design System
- **Glass-morphism**: `card`, `glass-effect` CSS classes
- **Animations**: Consistent Framer Motion patterns
- **Colors**: Blue-purple gradient theme with opportunity-based color coding
- **Responsive**: Mobile-first approach with Tailwind breakpoints

## ⚠️ Known Considerations
- Bundle size: 704KB (consider dynamic imports for optimization)
- CSS warning: Google Fonts import order (doesn't break build)
- ServiceOpportunityMatrix is core GTM component - handle with care

## 🔄 Common Tasks

### Adding New Visualizations
1. Define TypeScript interfaces in `types/index.ts`
2. Add mock data to `data/mockData.ts`
3. Create component in `components/`
4. Update `App.tsx` layout
5. Test build and commit with descriptive message

### Updating GTM Metrics
- Focus on implementation gaps and service opportunities
- Use research-backed data points
- Maintain opportunity scoring methodology

**Remember**: This dashboard is a marketing tool showcasing the business case for AI implementation services. Every change should reinforce the acceleration gap thesis.
